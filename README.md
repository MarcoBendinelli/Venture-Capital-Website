This project aimed to design and implement a high quality web-based hypermedia application for both stationary and mobile devices, focusing primarily on conceptual design and then to the practical implementation. It introduced the IDM Model as a framework for defining information architectures, navigation, interaction, and presentation features of complex multi-channel applications, with an emphasis on ensuring a seamless and effective user experience across different contexts.

Within the documentation folder, you will discover the [Design](documentation/Design_Report.pdf) and [Technical](documentation/Technical_Report.pdf) report of the implemented website, as well as a [Usability](documentation/Usability_Report.pdf) report aimed at analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of an external website.
